# Simple Windows Keylogger (Educational Project)
📌 Overview

This project is a simple educational keylogger written in C++ using the Windows API.
It was built as a learning exercise to understand how keyboard input is handled at a low level in Windows and to gain hands‑on experience with system programming concepts.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is created strictly for educational and learning purposes.
It is intended to be used only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
Any misuse of this software is not the responsibility of the author.

🎯 Motivation

The main goals of this project were to:
Explore low‑level keyboard input handling in Windows
Learn how Windows hooks work internally
Strengthen understanding of C++ system‑level programming
Gain experience reading documentation and debugging unfamiliar APIs
This project was not built as a real-world tool, but as a learning milestone.

🛠️ Technologies Used

C++
Windows API (windows.h)
Development environment: Windows
Learning resources: documentation, tutorials, and experimentation

✨ Features

Captures keyboard input from the system
Logs pressed keys into a .txt file
Demonstrates usage of Windows keyboard hooks
Simple and readable implementation for learning purposes

🧠 Challenges Faced

Understanding Windows API functions and parameters
Learning why each keyword and hook is required
Debugging syntax and logical errors
Adapting to low‑level, event‑driven programming concepts

📚 What I Learned

1-Basics of the Windows API and system hooks
2-How keyboard input is processed at a low level
3-Better understanding of C++ memory and callbacks
4-Improved debugging and problem‑solving skills
5-How software can monitor system-level events

🚧 Limitations

1-Very basic implementation
2-No encryption or obfuscation
3-Console-based only
4-No background persistence
5-Windows-only

🔮 Possible Improvements

1-Better handling of special keys
2-Cleaner logging format
3-GUI version
4-More structured code architecture
5-Configurable output options

📁 Project Status

This project represents an early learning stage and serves as a foundation for future system‑level or Windows‑based C++ projects.
